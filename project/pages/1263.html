Apologies for the late thread. And thank you to Jesse for taking up the mantle for the October edition, I appreciate that a lot. <br />
<br />
But enough of these pleasantries. It&#039;s time to get down and dirty with some opinions about comics. <br />
<br />
What has thou bought and therein, what has thou thought of your purchases? <br />
<br />
Just a reminder of some of the rules:<br />
<br />
1. Don&#039;t just make a list of what you bought. It&#039;s lame....<br />

This board has gone on too long without a designated thread to post pictures of our collections and make everyone jealous. So I made a new one.

<b>Batman </b>- really, really good read. Nice to see some old villains.<br />
<b>Nightwing </b>- gives me background story to the main bat book, but it is not a supporting book, it stands on its own and expands the bat universe nicly. <br />
<b>Deathstroke </b>- average but going to stick with it.<br />
<b>Supergirl</b> - AAARGH! horrible.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently picked up a crossover from 1995 which has Spiderman and Batman teaming up. Its an interesting read not only for the novelty of seeing Marvel and DC do something like this. But its just a fun goofy story that I enjoyed. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/7/7b/Spider-Man_and_Batman_Vol_1_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080108015748" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#x200B;IMG]" data-url="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/7/7b/Spider-Man_and_Batman_Vol_1_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080108015748" /> <br />
<br />
This one was published by Marvel. Its interesting because the cover has a noticeable Blue tint which seems more DC...<br />

DOOM!<br />
<br />
Doom has been on my mind as of late, with the recent announcement of Doom taking over the Infamous Iron Man series. <br />
<br />
But we should probably talk about comics that have come out this month, right?<br />
<br />
Anyway, as usual, here&#039;s some rules:<br />
<br />
1. Don&#039;t just make a list of what you bought. Keep that brain train going with some thoughts about said books, that you bought. <br />
<br />
2. Talk about hot, new issues or...<br />

I&#039;m collecting Pop Vinyl figures of comic book characters that were part of either the Justice League<br />
or the main Avengers roster, and I want to ask if these characters were part of either team in any<br />
point in time:<br />
<br />
Marvel:<br />
- She Hulk<br />
- Deadpool<br />
- Doctor Strange<br />
- Ghost Rider<br />
- Silver Surfer<br />
- Falcon ( not as Captain America but as Falcon )<br />
<br />
DC:<br />
- Power Girl<br />
- Super Girl<br />
- Firestorm<br />
<br />
Were any of these characters part of either the Justice League or the main Avengers roster ?]]></content:encoded>
