<p><em>(c) Termination of Your Subscription. </em>You acknowledge that Ziff Davis, in its sole discretion, may terminate your ID, password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Premium Service for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, if Ziff Davis believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms or any other agreement referred to in the Terms.

You agree that any termination of your access to the Premium Service under any provision of the Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Ziff Davis may immediately deactivate or delete your account and/or bar any further access to the Premium Service.
