      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had this issue for a couple of days now and haven&#039;t figured it out yet, so I thought I&#039;d try posting here.<br />
<br />
I can access my profile and view my stuff and blog posts and whatnot, but when I click &quot;write a new post&quot; I get sent to a login screen (<i>even though I&#039;m already logged in</i>).  The Captcha picture thing then seemingly runs on a loop forever, never doing anything no matter how many times I complete it.<br />
<br />
Is there something I&#039;m missing...?]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I have had issues with it for years on every single device I&#039;ve ever used, it is so frustrating. <br />
<br />
I now have a gaming PC and 150mb internet connection and your videos still do not load properly, even when I select a low resolution. Why don&#039;t you just embed Youtube videos of the same content like you did years ago?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Does anyone else experience this?<br />
<br />
When writing a lengthy comment I fill up the comment box. Instead of scrolling down so that I can keep typing the box starts hiding my current line of typing so that I can&#039;t see what I&#039;m writing. <br />
 I have to stop typing and then use the scroll bar to look at what I&#039;ve written to make sure I haven&#039;t spelled anything wrong. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s going on with the comment box? I use Firefox, is that what it might be?]]></content:encoded>

It is only this site in all of the Internet where I see this, and it only happens in Chrome, not in Edge or even Firefox. And this is not an issue with one computer, because I see it in all of my three computers....<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello IGN I have had respect for you all and your work for YEARS!, But first time in years that the website has me all pissed off.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mind seeing ads here and there, and the ads of the videos and much more, it can be handled.<br />
<br />
That I can&#039;t handle personally is the fact that you have pages doing AJAX calls every 2 seconds to do some ad refresh or to do some sort of &quot;ping&quot; this is quite annoying because it slows down the page functionality.<br />
<br />
also on the same page inside the articles...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If this doesnt belong here than please move it to where it needs to go. So I have been following ign facebook page for years, I dont comment on the posts. Woke up this morning and I am no longer able to like/follow/comment on the page and I would like to know why? I havent commented on anything and havent had any kind of issues with any of the admins or community members. So what the heck happened?]]></content:encoded>

I have asked questions and made comments on various IGN articles and no one has replied to anything in 16 days. I have even replied to a Mod post and asked if he could see my replies and even the Mod never responded. Please help.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[How can I disable or turn off the auto play feature.  When a video ends it is nice to see some suggestions but before I can read all of the titles it just starts playing the first one.  There is really no need to automatically start the next video.  Just give us the suggestions and let us decide when and if to press play.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am able to follow people, I am fine with that.<br />
I would like to follow games, to add them to my collection. However, the follow button that is supposedly under the game title is not there.<br />
 <br />
Also, how do you rate games? There is text saying &#039;slide to rate&#039;, but there is no slider..?]]></content:encoded>
