      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Does anyone know what were the best EXCLUSIVE commodore 64 games?<br />
<br />
Many C64 games are crappy ports of games that came out on other platforms but what about the hidden gems you could ONLY find on C64?  By ONLY C64 I mean ONLY C64, not games that came out on C64 and then came out with upgraded Amiga versions later.  C64 ONLY please<br />
<br />
The only one I can think of off the top of my head is &quot;Mail order monsters&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can anyone name any others?<br />
<br />
Thanks]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I love hunting for original Xbox games. So many great games on the system. Over all I think the system has aged pretty well. The games look pretty good on a hd tv with component cables. I have about 80 games for it so far. Lots of deal out there to be found. It&#039;s one system that hasn&#039;t been picked over yet.<br />
<br />
Notable game that I like are<br />
<br />
Panzer Dragoon Orta<br />
Crimson Skies<br />
Amped 1 &amp; 2<br />
Stubs the Zombie<br />
Jade Empire<br />
Star War KOTOR 1 &amp; 2<br />

Today I’d like to discuss our collection of retro video games, so let’s share which retro consoles we own and our games on those consoles. Posting an image isn’t required, but I’d really...<br />

I only played NES and PC/DOS in the early era and so those 80&#039;s games are difficult for me to remember cause I was so young. Remembering first time getting sword in Legend of Zelda is amazing, but something about the long lost games that just feels so amazing.<br />

In 2014 I was lucky enough to take part in an amazing Kickstarter project, started by George Oldziey himself - orchestral recording of Wing Commander 3, 4 and 5 music.

Out of the pre-SotN games, Rondo of Blood is my personal favorite. It was challenging, but it wasn&#039;t frustrating like Dracula&#039;s Curse. It had multiple pathways and multiple characters to play as adding more replay value. It didn&#039;t suffer from an obscene amount of...<br />

So great news, GameStop will likely have more selection cause they have already been selling classic stuff on their website.<br />

The games and stuff are only certain consoles, not all classic machines:<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey was on Steam playing the Sega Mega Drive &amp; Genesis Classics, when I noticed that the sound in the emulation isn&#039;t that great. After checking the discussions there, I ran into someone who stated that the Genesis sound was superior to the SNES, until they made different models.<br />
<br />
It blew me away because, as a Sega fan, I had always thought the sound was the weakest point in my war against Nintendo.<br />
<br />
He specifically pointed out the first Mortal Kombat as an example, which also blew me away...<br />

Well, that was news to me.<br />

So, decided to make a thread about it, so that we could all celebrate the 20 year old machine.<br />

Which should I get for old school platforming cartoony fun? They both have Rayman. I know Xbox one has rare replay which is cool but I don&#039;t know about anything new they have made or are making. I know PS4 has Rachet &amp; Clank and Crash Remastered on the way. Could you recommend which console to get and which games I might like?<br />

I remember playing this with my brother in the late 80&#039;s, just barely. It was this weird full motion video game that worked by attaching all of that crap to your TV and using a VCR. The little toy car on the bar would attach to the bottom of the screen, and the wheel would control that. It would physically move as you turned the wheel, and...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, when you were kid, was there any gaming related stuff that you kept bugging your parents about till they finally gave in and bought you that stuff?<br />
<br />
For example, maybe there was a new game you really wanted, so you kept nagging your parents about it for weeks till they finally cried:<b> fine, here&#039;s your game you little devil, happy now?<br />
</b><br />
Or maybe a new gizmo for your nintendo that you just had to have. So you kept bugging your parents and so on...<br />

Yesterday I found SEGA Superstars for PS2 at fleamarket.<br />
<br />
When I got home I noticed it requires EyeToy to play. And I dont have EyeToy...<br />
<br />
So, I came here to ask for some info on the EyeToy.<br />
<br />
So, could you tell me:<br />
<br />
1.Is EyeToy any good fun? Are EyeToy games fun to play, or just plain rubbish?<br />
<br />
2. How durable is this EyeToy? If you got EyeToy, is it still working perfectly or has it gone haywire?<br />
<br />
3.Does the EyeToy work with all PS2 models?<br />
<br />
4.Is there any really important stuff I...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Commodore 64 was utterly brill home computer and gaming machine. Here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
1. Massive games library. More than 2000 games were made for C64. Which is a lot.<br />
-sure, half the games were a bit sad, but that still left 1000 quality titles.<br />
<br />
2. NES ports. Huge amount of NES games were ported to C64, including such classics as Deja Vu and Super Mario Bros. <br />
-so, if you had C64, you really did not need NES. You already had best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
3. Programming. <br />
-you could program your Commodore...<br />

And it&#039;s always novel seeing games you may have spent weeks, or even months on, be done in only a day. This is especially relevant to classic games which seem to be the most popular/well known ones for speedruns.<br />

<br />
I&#039;m planning on playing through Resident Evil 2&amp;3 this week. On PS1.<br />
<br />
Now, here&#039;s the thing:<br />
After PS1, I have not played a single Resi game. So, that Resi 3 is the newest one I got.<br />
<br />
But I know there has been lot of Resi games after it, and after PS1.<br />
<br />
<b>So, what are the best Resi games on PS2, GC, Xbox, Wii, 360 and PS3???</b><br />
-meaning what Resi games on those systems are actually worth playing???<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.]]></content:encoded>

&quot;I think the game is a little too hard right from the start. Enemy waves get pretty crowded and projectiles (music notes) are quite big, making them hard to avoid. And with only one life, it feels too unforgiving. &quot; ——hvianna. Thanks, have done √.<br />

I&#039;ve been waiting for at least some rumours to come about a sequel for the game or at least a prequel or whatever. In the las few months I&#039;ve seen some things about a movie (I am not interested) but still nothing about the game itself, in my opinion this game was so freaking awesome when it came out. So the question remains:<br />
-Are we gonna see it ? <br />
What do you think ?]]></content:encoded>
