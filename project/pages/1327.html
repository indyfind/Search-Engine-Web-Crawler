      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So a few weeks ago I was on vacation in Canada and I bought The Last of Us on the ps3.<br />
I had read that ps3 games aren&#039;t region locked, so I assumed that the game would work just fine in my ps3 at home. But when I tried to play the game, the game wouldn&#039;t go passed the loading screen. I researched what could be the problem and I found that there may be problems because of the HTCS and PAL differences of tvs. But I also read that nowadays HDTV&#039;s shouldn&#039;t be having such problems at all.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Python</b> developers are needed to help recreate the Pirates of the Caribbean Online! (Now called Pirates Online Retribution!) It would be good (but not needed) if you were proficient in the following things: Python, familiarity with Panda 3D the Astron Database, and Linux server clusters. The developers willing to do this can get good rewards!(Can be negotiated)<br />

If you are able to help build this game please contact me via PM! (Skype would be nice!)<br />
