      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It&#039;s pretty much official, Britain is gonna leave the EU. Brexit won the referendum with a mere 3,8% over Bremain (51,9 vs 48,1). Cameron has anounced he will step down and the process of leaving the EU is expected to be completed in a couple of years.<br />
<br />
It seems that the economy dislikes the decision, as stock market is down and the value of the pound has dropped considerably.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a curiosity. Which web statistics is easier?<br />
<br />
Like so far I know, GA set-up is not so easy. A new person who has not enough knowledge on web statistics, He/She will not set-up GA easily. For that reason I want to know the easiest web statistics company. I have already tried to find the best one. And I got two.<br />
<ol>
<li>StatCounter<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>GoStats</li>
</ol>But GoStats is easier then StatCounter.<br />
<br />
This is only my thinking. If you have something new and special then please tell me.<br />
<br />
Or If...<br />

No one is listening to the liberal-leaning lame-stream media gate -keepers as their monopoly is now broken by the free market forces of supply and demand as new sources outside their control supply the demand from information from differing POVs<br />

It is now the next business day and in about 30 minutes it has already dropped %1. If this keeps up I believe microsoft&#039;s stock hit drop by about %10 by the end of the day. How much do you think it will drop by the end of the day?]]></content:encoded>

Personally, I&#039;m not shocked or surprised about it. I&#039;ve noticed the past few years this whole white knight reaction to every controversial topic.
