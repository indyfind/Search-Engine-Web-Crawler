      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all, <br />
I&#039;ve created a video that takes an in-depth look at the movie, analyzing different interpretations and meanings, and explaining some of the themes and complexities around its script. <br />
<br />
Obviously spoilers (and it&#039;s long), but hopefully you enjoy it regardless of my annoying commentary! <br />

Thanks, <br />

<b><span style="font-size: 18px">What are your most awaited movies of 2017? </span></b><br />
<br />
Mine are: Dunkirk, John Wick: Chaper 2: Alien: Covenant, War for the Planet of the Apes.<br />

What I&#039;d like to do is to make a list of IGN community&#039;s most awaited films afterwards. You can all vote here, name as many films as you like, and when 2017 is finally here, I will simply count all the votes and name most awaited movies of 2017. Each of you can name...<br />

I still love a lot of classic and modern horror movies but they aren&#039;t scary. Take the Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I love both movies but I find them quite comical. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve become desensitized by them. Do you guys get scared  by any horror movies? If so could you name them so I might watch them?]]></content:encoded>

Cloud Atlas, running at 172 minutes, was trashed by the majority of movie critics.  Then came The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which was again trashed for apparently being &quot;too&quot; fleshed out and having &quot;too much&quot; story as it&#039;s made to be overly long...Now, I just checked Metacritic and Les Mis is getting mediocre reviews as well, mostly because its runtime is apparently too prolonged....<br />

What I liked about <i>Assault on Arkham</i> was that despite having a PG-13 rating, it was an experience surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining for an adult - there was blood, a ton of violence, swearing, sex, nudity, dark humor, you name it. I was surprised how much adult-oriented content they could cram into that movie and still get away with a...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a couple days now.. I was wondering if iconic live-action movie characters&#039; legacies kind of die out when the actor/actress who played them dies. I mean, obviously their characters will still be remembered for their impacts they had, but is it different compared to an animated character? Compare Sean Connery James Bond with Snow White or something- Sean Connery will die eventually, but Snow White is immortal. Does that change how they are respectively...<br />

Eisenberg actually made me interested in Lex Luthor for once, because before his performance as the character, Lex just came off as a generic, mustache twirling villain.

Over a decade ago, Tobey Maguire&#039;s first two Spidey and first two X-Men movies were released and it seems everybody liked them because nobody gave a sh*t about comic-based movies that were nothing like the comics back in the days. Nobody did because those movies had their own origins and they were well acted, written and directed. Yes, those were faithful to Spider-Man...<br />

I love period movies like this because I love history. The American Revolution, The Civil War, WW1 &amp; WWII, etc. I like studying the weapons, tactics, vehicles and getting into the minutia of things like the slope of a tank&#039;s armor, etc. <br />
<br />
But more than that I love the stories of the individuals. Take the story of Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown <i><b>&quot;A Higher Call&quot;</b></i> for example. Instead of shooting down Charlie...<br />

But when I looked up &quot;Universal monsters&quot; on Wikipedia, it gave me this list:<br />

Also would you be more inclined to watch a movie that has a more diverse cast than another film?<br />
