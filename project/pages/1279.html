<br />
So The Good Place went from 8 million down to 5 million.  Is it going to be canceled?  It went from a 2.28 down to a 1.40, is that awful or normal?  If I wasn&#039;t married and Veronica Mars lived in Colorado would she be into me?<br />

Larry did a pretty great job as a host, even though the show only occasionally had the bite of his fellow former Daily Show hosts, John Oliver and Samantha Bee. For a good long run there, though, he was better than Trevor Noah and often still is. I rarely watched the roundtable segments, but I suppose they weren&#039;t any...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This generation sucks so far. Half of the new television shows are broken and the ones that do work are remakes and reboots. The last good reboot for television was Battlestar Galactica, IMO. The reason why I&#039;m creating this thread because I still couldn&#039;t believe Hollywood remade/rebooted &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; into the television shows but seriously, studios needs to stop this bullshit already!<br />
<br />
PS. I can say that Hollywood will decide to reboot &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; into the movie...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I’m a student in a film/TV school. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> As part of a homework, I must analyze a TV show (whether contemporary or historical) promoting carrierism, financial success, materialism, etc. Featuring guests that would be very rich, at the top of their profession, bragging about their ‘successful life’, etc. <br />
<br />
You see what I mean ?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don’t know any TV show of this kind... So I was wondering if you guys could help me ? <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
Thank you very much if you have any clue <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/4.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":D" title="Grin    :D" />...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I only had a little bit of money and I spent it on Shadows of Mordor and a bunch of piddly games.  I don&#039;t quite have enough money to buy No Man&#039;s Sky this week.  Maybe next week.  I&#039;m usually not one to buy brand new games because so very pricey, but I might splurge on No Man&#039;s Sky.  I&#039;m really worried it will be boring.  But if I start late all the planets will already be named Tickle Butt and Fart Cruncher.  All the good names will be taken!<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t know.  Is anyone buying it this...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[And crooked Hilary is the co-founder!<br />
<br />
This is really disappointing because I don&#039;t like ISIS very much.  No offense to ISIS members, but they aren&#039;t a good organization at all.  Many bad things are attributed to them.  <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t believe Hilary thought we wouldn&#039;t find out.  Well to be fair I just found out about Obama, but I won&#039;t be fooled again.  <br />
<br />
At least the truth is finally coming out.  Finally.<br />
<br />
This has been a really eye opening election period.  I&#039;m learning so much.]]></content:encoded>
