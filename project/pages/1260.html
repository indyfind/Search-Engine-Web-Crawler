<br />
the other book is one that just blows my mind… A Strange Manuscript Found In A Copper Cylinder by James De Mille , from 1888 <br />
<br />
I need more recommendations for an assignment … it can be anything provided it&#039;s from before 1945 and is at a relatively high velocity analytically speaking .]]></content:encoded>

I decided it was time to look for something in books, since <i>Silent Hill 2</i>&#039;s storyline is remarkably bookish anyway.<br />

My favorite so far is definitely Prey. Such a crazy read - especially with his descriptions towards the end. The suspense is also really well done. I read this one in a couple days, same with The Terminal Man. I couldn&#039;t seem to put them down. <br />

<br />
The problem is that I don&#039;t like it when they dig too much into the science behind it. I prefer sci-fi settings and the future technologies within them to focus on framing plot, character, themes, etc. I don&#039;t want the science itself to be the focus. <br />

After looking around online I ordered the Altered Carbon trilogy, and was wondering if anyone here had any good suggestions?]]></content:encoded>

<br />
In case anyone is interested, I recently wrote a horror anthology novel. Here is the description:<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven people in the town of Springlight Falls participate in a sleep study where, once asleep, they are stalked by a murderous scarecrow. As the killer chases them, they decide to tell each other stories, hoping to wake up before they are slain one by one.&quot;<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Where the heck did this come from? I&#039;ve seen Übermensch pop up a few times online in the last couple of weeks and decided to check it out... um, what a crazy book. Far future dystopian science fiction that gets right to the action. Genetic modification, crazy post-human characters, action, etc. I liked it, but talk about a gutpunch debut. Anyone else read this yet? I have a lot of questions about what happened and what it meant.<br />

<br />
I want something that focuses mostly on one hero.  Someone who is a badass or an anti hero would be great.<br />
<br />
I am currently reading the vampire hunter d novels and am looking for something similar.  Similar also to berserk manga.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been trying to google some books of this genre and don&#039;t know which ones are good.  I am mostly a suspense mystery type fan, but would like to explore more of this genre, dark fantasy.<br />

So far the only...<br />

I came to a realization on an author I used to love and in fact was the key to getting me into reading. Long silly story short, I didn&#039;t get into reading until my early 20&#039;s. I used to hate reading to be honest. Then one day a friend of mine bet me money I couldn&#039;t read Dark Elf Trillogy by RA Salvatore in a week.

A mage, rogue, or warrior would be great choices in no real order of want. If they did back alley dealings, bar fights, maybe some mercenary work all of these things would be great. But I really want the whole of the story to take place in an urban area. I&#039;m not too familiar with the towns in the Forgotten Realms universe but not drow books or stories about monsters as the protagonist. Also if they...<br />

It started good but by the end I didn&#039;t understand the significance of it. Could someone enlighten me as to why people say this book is a must read?]]></content:encoded>
