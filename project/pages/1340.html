      <content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the Consumer Rights Bill documentation that&#039;s got published today, there is a digital section where there is a segment which means that substandard digital content or content that is misleading or not as described can be refunded to the customer.<br />
 <br />
Digital content does include the full games and DLC.<br />
 <br />
It is official that right now under UK law customers can demand and get their money back.<br />
