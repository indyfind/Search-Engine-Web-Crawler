However soon after creating the account I started to go through some bloggers, clicking follow on a couple, as well as going through games and following a tonne of those. After going back to my profile after the follow session I discovered that only 1 game had been successfully followed, and 0 people.<br />

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated, I&#039;m...<br />

Can anybody let me know if this is a common issue and if so are there going to be updates to fix.<br />

Like seriously!  How does Ark Survival Evolved not have an individual games forum???<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other games that don&#039;t have a forum too.  I understand IGN can&#039;t allow us to create whole new links to forums, but give us a &quot;suggest a new forum&quot; option where we email them a contact asking for one.  Then they can approve it and create it or deny it.]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I have IGN Prime Legacy 2 year okay, and ends sometime next year.<br />
<br />
If I changed the subscription now to the Prime - Annual... What would happen?<br />
<br />
Like would it change straight away and I lose my legacy thing, would I be billed when legacy ends I do not know as it is not clear.<br />
<br />
Also what does the legacy mean and stand for... The price is hefty and the prime annual is way cheaper so I am thinking that is all.<br />

Thank You!]]></content:encoded>

<br />
This sets me back $79.95, billed every two years.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between this account and the plain old IGN Prime account which costs $29.95 billed annually? Which means it costs exactly $10 less for the same period of time? Is there any advantage to paying that extra $10, apart from the small convenience of getting billed only once every two years?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[And before I get a bunch of  snotty people saying, &quot;There aren&#039;t any, those are two totally unique games&quot;, don&#039;t even start.

<br />
When I post a comment it says, &quot;We are unable to post your comment because you have been blocked by IGN Articles.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if this is the proper place to ask this, but I have no idea where else to go. I would like to keep coming here, but if I can&#039;t participate in the discussion then I will just travel to somewhere else.<br />
<br />
After all this is my first offense of being banned or black listed from comment articles shouldn&#039;t this be a two day warning...<br />
