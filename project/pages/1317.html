      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Or did they just decide they needed a new Michael Waltrip? Yes Bowyer has a goofy side. It&#039;s been known for years. So why all of a sudden are they making a big deal out of Bowyer&#039;s goofiness? For the past 4-5 races the Fox crew has gone over board boasting his antics. It seems odd to me.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a few days I&#039;ve a boxing match where I can choose my own music for my walk to the ring.<br />
I allready have a few numbers I want but can choose one. But what I want to know is: What is your favourite number when you doing your excercise in the gym, at (kick)boxing or any other sports?<br />
 <br />
At fitness I like to listen to Rick Ross - King of Diamonds, Rick Ross - Hold me Back, Bone Crusher - Saw Theme (remix), 50 Cent - I&#039;ll Whip Ya Head Boy &amp; Eminem - Till I Collapse.<br />
 <br />
Those are my favourite...<br />
