I&#039;ve come into a little extra cash and with this whole PS4 Pro/Scorpio business tearing away at the traditional console space (Imo), I&#039;ve been more motivated than ever to finally make PC my primary platform.<br />

I want to build a computer that will shit all over games and eat benchmarks for breakfast.  And I want a build that looks good too, with an RGB water cooler, RGB fans, an RGB motherboard, tempered glass case, and possibly RGB RAM if they come out with an option that&#039;s not stupid (currently the only RGB RAM I could find requires extra cables to power the LED&#039;s).<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I hope posting here to ask this question is not rude...  if you think so, just point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re creating a game based on playing as a dragon.  We&#039;re looking for feedback from more players as we get ready for release.<br />
<br />
Since the expectations for dragons are fairly high, and assuming we have a stable game, what should we be sure to avoid in our game?  Or, if you like, what do we need to be sure to include?<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton!<br />

Mainly I want it to be able to run Solidworks for him. By refurbish I mean take the old PC gut it and put in new components. The PC I am working with was this old HP Media center PC from like 2005 or so I think. The case I think should work fine.<br />

Anyone here with suggestions? I really want to stay under $100 (under $80 would be even better).]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard a lot of bad about this game and was wondering what the deal is<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve read that its not actually online because there was some story that 2 people coordinated to be in the same place at the same time but didn&#039;t see each other...is this true?<br />
<br />
What else is going on with this game?  I read that you can go to different worlds and they all have different randomly generated creatures.   That sounds pretty awesome.  Why does it have such a bad rep and is it really online?<br />
<br />
Thanks]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[My current PC is very outdated and I&#039;m looking to upgrade it to be able to play games in 4K resolution.<br />
<br />
Here is my current build:<br />
Graphics card: GTX 570<br />
CPU: AMD FX 8350<br />
Ram: 16GB<br />
Motherboard: Sabertooth990FX R2.0<br />
750Watt power supply<br />
Storage: 250GB SSD, 1TB HDD<br />
<br />
Will I need to upgrade both my graphics card and processor to achieve this? I have heard that the GTX 1070 can handle that resolution, but I do not know what CPU I would have to get.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I would not want to overclock anything...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Haven&#039;t done anything like this in years so I&#039;m terribly rusty. It&#039;s going to be for everyday personal use, writing, e-mails and gaming. I&#039;m no casual, but I&#039;m not a hardcore enthusiast either. Hell if the video card wasn&#039;t audibly failing (given that it&#039;s nearly 7 years old), I could probably continue to ignore it, but I doubt the old PC is going to last another summer.<br />

First thing I did was shop around locally for prices and rigs but the absolute cheapest I could find was for $850 and...<br />

After doing research on Internet i came to know that 8ms is the descent value. But some said that we should also consider the performance of our CPU and GPU to select the response time.<br />

The specs I selected for my new PC is:<br />
CPU: intel core i5 6600k<br />
