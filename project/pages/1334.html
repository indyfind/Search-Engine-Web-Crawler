      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve recently started getting into eating fruit salads, however I mostly ate them at restaurants or at friends&#039; places. I want to start making them myself soon, I am however very inexperienced about cooking/preparing food in general. So here&#039;s my question for all of you: what experiences do you have with fruit salads? Are there any special methods of preparation you use/any ingredients apart from fruit you think should be a part of it? Which fruits do you feel are important ingredients? Do...<br />

It didn&#039;t look like it when I was working on it, but it does appear to be kind of bulbous on the one end.  The mulch (a combination of grass clippings from this year and last year and the remains of some of last year&#039;s plants) on the left side there is spilling over, I might fix that but when this garden is grown out, you won&#039;t be able to see the sides of it anyway.  The whole thing is about 10 feet by 20...<br />

It was just because the box was damaged apparently, it clearly has never been used....<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;m a pretty basic gardner, bought some perrenials for my garden this year, threw down some mulch a little over a month ago, and I go water them when it seems like it&#039;s been too dry, so that&#039;s about the extent of my horticulture knowledge.<br />
<br />
Went to water today and there&#039;s this weird stuff in my garden! I accidentally watered over it and it released a bunch of brown &quot;smoke&quot; (I&#039;m guessing spores?) and of course I panicked because I didn&#039;t know if I should be breathing that in or not. Anyone...<br />
