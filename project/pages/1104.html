I&#039;ll always move on to new things whenever remastered PS3/X360 I&#039;ve played are out, remakes/reboots of movies and television shows from the past get released, buying Digimon and Pokemon toys, Yugioh cards, watching 90&#039;s shows on Cartoon Network, and I could go on and on.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now, there is one good side to MOBAs I&#039;d enjoy, and that is the way a typical MOBA would crank out a large cast of playable characters to make up for its complete lack of map diversity.  And, those characters are useful for a variety of different roles, no different from an RPG, such as strong/fast/ranged/magical offense, defense/tanking, and healing/support.<br />

The series was originally titled Castle Dracula, but then some marketing genius named it Castlevania (a clever fusion of the words Castle and Transylvania).

Roy Mustang handled Hughes&#039; death.  Mustang is a strong, no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners commanding officer of his own unit, willing make the hard choices in order to complete each and every objective he&#039;s given, hence his ruthlessness against Lust when trying to avenge Hughes death....<br />

<br />
As a kid, I&#039;ve always fell for anything that was hyped to death, no matter how much it was garbage.  I consumed tons of Mighty Morphin&#039; Power Rangers and Pokemon, and went to Sonic the Hedgehog for that exact same reason.  And, the Macy&#039;s Thanksgiving Day Parade is no exception.<br />
<br />
But now that I&#039;m older, I don&#039;t want hype, flash, and other...<br />

But I noticed a trend: gamerz seem to rage and shout death threats against reviewers and journalists for just reviewing or bringing news about the delay of a game! I, as a student in his last year for Dutch high school, an going to research why gamers do this more often(to my knowledge) then for example movie goers. So, the question is: why do gamers rage so much at what matters so...<br />

<br />
Master Chief, belonging in an FPS series, is a one-man army with high amounts of firepower, agility, and endurance.  Jim Raynor, on the other hand, is more geared toward a leadership position, because the series he appears in is an RTS.  And Commander Shepard, being part of a party-based RPG, is in-between...<br />

And, I think I know why it was inevitable, as well: Because of the stagnation and downfall of fantasy JRPGs.<br />

Ever since the fifth generation, which introduced Final Fantasy VII, tons of other developers cranked out JRPGs of their very own to compete with FFVII.  As a result, by the time we got...<br />
