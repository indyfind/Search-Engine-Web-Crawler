      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Also reopening the icons board would be pretty cool but seriously these new smaller icons suck. <br />
<br />
Honestly I&#039;d prefer a long rectangle canvas sized around 140x190 as I think that would look much nicer than square icons and fit the boards better but making them smaller .... it&#039;s just .... hideous]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I find it quite annoying when I see an interesting sounding news headline on the front page, which actually leads to a Wiki article. Would it be possible to have on all Wiki articles a small tag stating that it is a Wiki page, or better yet, have a nice red banner with the words &quot;WIKI&quot; across the corner of the thumbnail image. For example, I can see the tag &quot;IGN ACCESS&quot; for IGN access videos. That&#039;s a good thing to do, but it&#039;d be good if you could consistently do that for all other...<br />

The reason I opt back to the old timestamp is because only knowing how long ago a message was posted is impractical when you run a serious contest and need to know the exact time a post was made instantly.<br />

<br />
As you might not know, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion becomes ten years old today, at March 21.<br />

Given how hugely popular that legendary game still is, could you make a celebratory video about it?<br />

You know, Oblivion ten years old birthday video or somesuch.<br />

IMO the event is well worth celebrating, even though not many agree with me.<br />

I&#039;m not sure how old these are, but is there a possibility of getting an overhaul of new emoticons and a larger library of em?]]></content:encoded>

What is it? Also Can you not just adjust it with everyones current post count? SO people with 30,000 + posts aren&#039;t labeled as noobs? Its Kinda lame seeing as some people have been here for as much as 10 years and have Noob under there name, Or if not implement something with the reg dates?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[On a forum that I sometimes lurk there&#039;s an option in the top right corner of the thread to order everything by most daps, which is really useful for me when I find a 5+ page thread and don&#039;t have the time to read through everything.<br />
<br />
While IGN doesn&#039;t have a daps system, the like system I&#039;m assuming is the exact same thing and both boards run on XenForo iirc<br />
<br />
Curious to know if this will ever get implemented in the future.]]></content:encoded>
