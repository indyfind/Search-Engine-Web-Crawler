      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It appears that Nintendo is clearly learning from their marketing woes with the Wii U.<br />
<br />
Some things I noticed right away:<br />
<br />
- They built general hype and got the crowd engaged before even showing the Switch by showing off Super Mario Run first<br />
- Miyamoto was there in person which got the crowd even more engaged<br />
- Nintendo made it extremely clear what the Switch is by showing the console and controller side by side<br />
- Reggie pulled out a Pro Controller with zero hesitation, showing that either...<br />

Ive been thinking like cray after the reveal and the Nintendo Switch just isnt enough for my family it seems. Its cool and everything, but its missing some individualism that a family like mine requires. 3DS and Wii U works great. The kids and us can enjoy Wii U together, by themselves, or even while were watching TV Shows.<br />
<br />
Then the 3DS is even better. All 3 have one and even myself. Each even have their own games....<br />

I can&#039;t imagine Nintendo selling it solo at launch...would be too confusing for clueless consumers who buy the cheapest SKU and complain they can&#039;t get the image on their tv...and they probably don&#039;t have enough at launch to sell that way.<br />

Just wondering when might be a good time to approach that market?<br />

All I&#039;m saying, that Zelda is looking silky smooth even when it&#039;s undocked. Also, I&#039;m really digging the design of this bad boy! So what do you guys think of our little taste of the Switch before January? <br />
<br />
(On a side note, Mario Run actually looks pretty fun too!)<br />

<br />
So, call me late if you want, but only a couple weeks ago I finally got a 3DS family system: New 3DS XL. I only have Alpha Sapphire right now, but I&#039;d like to get a new game soon. Two games I have my eyes on are Super Mario Maker 3DS and Pokemon Moon (My friend has Sun), but I&#039;ve been stumped on what to get.<br />
<br />
I heard the new gen 7 games are much more refreshing than XY and ORAS, and that they are a step higher in difficulty....<br />

Its been 10 fucking years since the original NSMB came out on DS in 2006. Since then Nintendo stuck with the same graphic art style, even the same goddamn background music for all the levels, for 6 releases. Holy shit.<br />

There is still Zelda and some indie titles and whatnot but that&#039;s about it. I just recently moved my Wii U into my game room to make space for my new PS4 Slim. This is the first time since I was 5 when the NES broke that I haven&#039;t had a Nintendo system plugged into the main TV.<br />

I was just looking over my Wii U games, and realized quite suddenly, how few I had. Here&#039;s my purchases by year (not...<br />

I bet it outsells the Wii.  Nintendo should keep doing this and it should be releasing these games in packs like Sega used to for multiple consoles.  Seems to me like more people are interested in Nintendo 30 years ago than they are now.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was watching the latest Sony show last night and I noticed that most of their games announced have female leads.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[As the title says, that cannot be good and Nintendo will break irrelevance records by March next year.<br />
<br />
Everybody else is not just adding more games, but also heavily promoting their current hardware, even with excellent deals, meanwhile Nintendo simply doesn&#039;t exist. When you keep this way for so many months you simply get out the radar of most gamers, it doesn&#039;t matter if one year later you say, SURPRISE! look at this! because nobody would be still looking at you.
