      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday in my thread titled &quot;Poll: Most Disappointing Game of 2016&quot; I was called a &quot;Fucking Asshole&quot; by a user who knowingly said it even stating he didn&#039;t care if he got banned for saying it. I reported the post twice and nothing was done. I now see today the post has been removed and the user has had nothing done to them. No 1 day ban or anything. Even a reply to the post was deleted.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s clear to me the mods are covering it up and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a way you can look up what was said....<br />

(plus, if you have a grey/classic theme, the borders look really messy)<br />
<br />
<br />
And Twitter seems to load fine half the time, but the other half of time it looks like this:<br />

So there you have it. Facebook videos being cropped vertically. Tweets being cropped horizontally. UGH.]]></content:encoded>

<br />
Imagine our GFYCAT has an ID that reads &quot;AbdDefGhi&quot;<br />
<br />
The embed function creates this code:<br />


<div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
	<div class="type">Code:</div>
	<pre>[MEDIA=gfycat]AbcDefGhi[/MEDIA]</pre>
</div>And, as I said, it displays at a tiny size.<br />
<br />

<iframe width="" height="" src="//gfycat.com/iframe/MealyFrayedHarborporpoise" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The app doesn&#039;t display the wiki guide articles.  Eg If I click on an article,  it then takes me to a white screen with &quot;Xbox One Wiki guide&quot;  written in red. <br />
If I then click on this,  it brings up a further list of articles written in red.  If I then click on any of these articles,  it reverts me back to the white screen with &quot;Xbox One Wiki guide&quot;. <br />
I have emailed the devs through the playstore but had no response.

<br />
this is what happens when I click the google login button, and select the account I want to login to.<br />
<br />
Its been like this for a week or so, I&#039;ve tried different browsers, different computers, clearing my cookies, different networks and even a fellow user in a completely different time zone was also having issues.<br />
<br />
If there is anything you could do to fix it It&#039;d be greatly appreciated.]]></content:encoded>
