                          relaxation, for mental work, or as a soundtrack for your day. I combine
                          my music with nature footage from beautiful places around the globe.

                          helped me a little: Ignore the trolls! While I have an uber-nice audience
                          and get negative comments very rarely, it still helps to know that you're
                          better of not taking any negative feedback personally.

                          During the first years I had to tell myself again and again that it might
                          take a while before the channel picks up some pace. Finally it worked for
                          me. I'm aware that there's always a bit of luck involved. I'm very
                          thankful that my work payed off at some point and continues to do so.

                          My core ability is to create music. I like to think that this is why
                          people come to my channel back again and again. I studied music
                          production on my own for more than 10 years before I started this
                          channel. Creating video felt rather natural.

                          Armed with a mobile phone and an idea, VlogAfterCollege’s Ryen Lung
                          tested out a few optimization strategies and found out which ones
                          clicked. Now he’s using basic equipment and marketing savvy to take his
                          channel to the next level (with a little help from his four-legged
                          friend, Gatsby).
