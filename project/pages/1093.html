It was the most successful Secret Santa since bringing the tradition to these boards. You guys know how this works. You sign up below and send me a mailing adress (it doesn&#039;t have to be your home) where you can pick up a package, as well as any information you care to give for the sort of gift you&#039;d be interested in (or a wish list).

I loved NYC during the meet, but I have some reservations about living there. Cost and weather are probably the two biggest things that stand out, coming from majorly warm places that are known for a great cost of living.<br />

I have mix feelings about this to be honest.

Researching ideas, I came across something I thought would go over well.  I bought it online.  It is supposed to arrive in time for the party, Sunday.  However, you can&#039;t trust shipping to this island.  As such, if it still hasn&#039;t arrived by Saturday, I will be scrambling to come up with a new gift idea.<br />

Megathread for Overwatch, open beta started, full launch is may 24th, but you can buy an early access beta code off ebay for 3 dollars. Easily the best multiplayer game of 2016.<br />

IDK if it&#039;s cross-platform, but it looks like there will be a strong showing both from the console and PC sides.<br />

Yay or nay? The trailer doesn&#039;t really impress me but I&#039;m hopeful because I&#039;m interested in this resurgence of monster movies. Also, I was a fan of the Brendan Fraser movies (at least the first two).]]></content:encoded>

Animanga = anime + manga<br />

Disclaimer: <b>spoilers</b>. Didn&#039;t use the tag because I don&#039;t like too many of those on the frontpage for megathreads.<br />

I&#039;ll mainly use this thread to talk about some of the random anime stuff I watch and manga I read, as time permits (I game too much atm).<br />
<br />
Potential talking points:<br />
<br />
-Anime/manga you&#039;ve watched in the past, currently watching, or looking forward to watching<br />
-Anime merch you got<br />
-Weekly discussions. This can even be just a simple...<br />
