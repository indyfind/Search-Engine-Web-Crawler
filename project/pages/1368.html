If I don&#039;t finish a game, Ill shut down and when I power up at a later time and go into franchise Mode, It will bring up my last game I didn&#039;t finish.

I don&#039;t know if the spammer has overwritten a real page or created a new one and changed the link on the previous page.

Whilst playing Fallout 4 I come across safes, terminals, locks etc which at my current level I am unable to open. I don&#039;t note them down and therefore forget where they are.

It launched on December 10th, but most gaming sites had their reviews up the first week of December. I&#039;m assuming since IGN is by far one of the largest gaming sites, they&#039;ve had access to a review code for a while.<br />
<br />
Basically, it&#039;s the closest thing to F-Zero/Wipeout/XtremeG that we&#039;ve had for a while. Highly recommended. Especially for fans of futuristic racers.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I KNOW I saved a TON of new data today for the ISO-8 upgrading page (Contest of Champions).<br />
<br />
I sat here typing a ton of data in, SAVED it, and now it&#039;s gone (and I can&#039;t get the data back, because I stupidly didn&#039;t save it somewhere else first, just put raw data as I was playing into the wiki) Is there any possible way to see if that info is floating around somewhere?<br />
<br />
I hate to think I&#039;m going to have to figure that all out again, it&#039;s pretty much impossible to retrieve the data again...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey guys,<br />
<br />
New member here =) I&#039;m trying to create a new Wiki for a space RTS called Starfall Tactics. Here it is on IGN: <a href="http://www.ign.com/games/starfall-tactics/pc-20033609" class="internalLink">http://www.ign.com/games/starfall-tactics/pc-20033609</a><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I&#039;ve run into some trouble. I get the first step &quot;Create a New Wiki&quot; and fill option A, which generates the name of the game. But nothing happens when I click &quot;Wiki, Create Thyself&quot;. The webpage just refreshes itself. Here&#039;s a screenshot....<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings.  I&#039;ve made a guide to the Arkham City Riddler Trophies, but I&#039;m not certain how to go about posting it.  Is there a maximum image size?  Is PDF recommended?  I have screen grabs and maps, as well as a list of the tools required to get them.  It&#039;s better than the guides I&#039;ve found (so far), so I&#039;d like to share it, BUT . . . like I said, I&#039;m not certain how IGN wiki goes about this or if there are restrictions.  Any info would be very helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks....<br />
