I can get it for PC but I understand that it&#039;s locked at 30fps and runs like shit.<br />

So I want to get it on Xbox bc the open world zombie stuff looks fun, but if I remember it had some problems like resolution looking like 720p and such.<br />

But in the end....is it a fun game and worth the current asking price?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry for another thread today, but I need to call on your guys expertise here. I&#039;m trying to get my gf to cancel her direct TV cause she&#039;s getting ripped off, and she doesn&#039;t really watch tv to begin with lol. Anyway, basically my question is what apps does Firestick have that Xbox One doesn&#039;t? I&#039;m thinking about just giving her my Xbox and getting hbo now, Netflix, etc. Is there anything better Firestick offers that Xbox doesn&#039;t? I know this one has the Alexa voice too, but can&#039;t Cortona...<br />
