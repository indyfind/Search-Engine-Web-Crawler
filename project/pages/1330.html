      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Trying to decide between a 07 Camry with 150k or 05 Escape with 110k.  Most car guys I know tell me Honda and Toyota are the way to go but does the extra 40k in mileage offset any of the Toyota reliability over the Ford.  <br />
<br />
The Camry is also a V6 so the oil consumption issue that seemed to plague allot of the 4 cylinder models around that year shouldn&#039;t be a factor.  Haven&#039;t had a chance to look at them in person yet but let&#039;s assume they were both well maintained.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So... I bought a car the other day and found that the previous owner had an auxiliary cord put in. I know it was a modification, but I assume it worked. However, I&#039;m not quite sure how to use it. The car is an 07 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT, by the way. Whenever I plug the cable into my phone, the car just keeps playing its radio. Am I doing something wrong or is there something wrong with the auxiliary setup? Any help would be greatly appreciated.]]></content:encoded>

My dad has a 2012 Mazda 3 i Sport, so it&#039;s pretty base, but he&#039;s getting about 37 mpg (not the skyactive engine, just the simple old MZR 2.0L) during his daily commute, and it sure is a fun little car to drive (what it lacks in power it makes up for in handling).<br />

 <br />
The other day, I had a scraping noise coming from my back left wheel. I&#039;ve had that problem before, and after giving it a blast with a power hose, a couple stones came out and all was good. But this time, after giving it a blast, the scraping noise has gotten better, but is still there when I take a tight left turn, and it&#039;s started rattling a bit. To me,...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[A while back my uncle had to take out my windshield wiper motor to fix some things and somehow the bolts to mount it back in got lost. I don&#039;t know what the technical name for them is, only that they&#039;re some kind of bolt that physically holds the wiper motor in place. I have a 96 Dodge Intrepid. If anybody could please PLEASE help me track down these pieces I would be infinitely grateful! I don&#039;t want to have to drive to class in the rain with no wipers. :/]]></content:encoded>

It&#039;s a 2006 Chevy Colorado with the 3.5L engine and an auto trans *cries* - it&#039;s really hard to find a decent deal on a Colorado/Canyon with the 5-cylinder engine and a manual trans - and right about 50k miles. It was T-boned on the passenger side and it rolled onto the drivers side. Supposedly the guy I bought it from was having the work done by a friend who decided he couldn&#039;t do any more work on it for free and the guy I bought it from didn&#039;t have any more money...<br />

 <br />
But when driving, particularly above 40mph. I get this noise from the front passenger tire (the one that went flat) and it makes me feel like I&#039;m about to have a flat tire, or the tire wants to come loose. I didn&#039;t hear this noise...<br />

Lexus IS is stealing customers from BMW with their new model. I find this interesting because the initial reaction on internet forums was that the &#039;IS is ugly&#039;.<br />
This leads me to believe that the people with the money to drive 40,000 dollar+ cars are not posting on car forums.]]></content:encoded>
