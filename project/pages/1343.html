 <br />
I&#039;ve never understood why somebody in a relationship would intentionally hide that fact, or hide the person they are in a relationship in.  Are there legitimate reasons to do it?<br />
 <br />
If a chick ain&#039;t wearing a ring, she&#039;s fair game till she says otherwise, ya know?  I know facebook isn&#039;t that serious, but it&#039;s just kinda odd that somebody in a relationship would...<br />

I lost interest in everything and also it started affecting my mood and the character when I decided to go for testosterone replacement therapy. With the supplements, I feel great now and the sex life got better.<br />
But, now I am worried about the therapy. I read on a blog that testosterone supplement can lead to heart attacks and stroke....<br />

<br />
So really, my question at that moment became how would the sex dynamics work. Now before you all freak out, i am not shallow or anything and i have nothing against fat girls though i am very slim-fit myself. For males, as i&#039;m sure most would agree...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello to all.<br />
<br />
I wanted to talk to you about a very serious topic : <b>Narcissists</b><br />
<br />
Narcissists are a category of people suffering from what is called NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder), they are, in my opinion, one of the most <b>psychologically destructive</b> people you can ever meet. <br />
<br />
They pretend to love and care for you, all the while they are planning your utter destruction.<br />
<br />
What makes them so dangerous is their advanced manipulation tactics they use on unsuspecting...<br />

Me and my boyfriend broke up about 2 months ago. We are both in our 30s and had talked about getting married before we were broken up. So we had a big fight and I had a family issue and let it out on him. I can say he was the best boyfriend I &#039;ve ever had. What I am really confused is that he never stops contacting me but doesn&#039;t want to get back together at the moment. What he&#039;s saying is he wants to take time...<br />

I don&#039;t masturbate with the toilet paper around it, but since I usually lay on my back while I do it, I have my phone in the other hand, I have some rolled up toilet paper on my stomach so I can just come into. SOMETIMES I shoot a little farther and well... we all know where that ends up.<br />

So around 4 months ago I met this girl at a social club in university and I was one of the executives of this club so I knew all the 15 members or so. She joined the club midway through the semester so I had no clue who she was.The first time I saw her totally caught me off guard cause she was so gorgeous and couldn&#039;t stop looking at her but didn&#039;t take it too seriously and wasn&#039;t attracted considering how anti-social/stuck-up she seemed....<br />

She apologized a week later for overreacting. I responded back but then she went days without saying anything. After 4 days she asked to see me but I just was still pissed about the whole to be honest so I wasn&#039;t receptive. Anyways she and I haven&#039;t talked in weeks. Based on her snaps she seems just fine. <br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;m 18 and i&#039;m still a virgin. It&#039;s sort of weird reading people&#039;s thoughts on virgins. We&#039;re depraved, bitter souls who are &quot;nice guys&quot;(you know the type) apparently. I&#039;m trying not to view losing my virginity as a race doe, just kind of seeing what happens in life.<br />
 <br />
Ideally, in my mind, I&#039;d just love to have sex with a hot chick and then end it from there. I just don&#039;t want a relationship. However this doesn&#039;t seem too realistic, one person may take it the wrong way and up getting hurt,...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know this is long but thank you if you read it and respond. Ok so i started a new job in March. It&#039;s a warehouse and is pretty big. Well anyways around April I met this girl who works there and I started talking to her because I had a crush on her. (I&#039;m 23 and she&#039;s 21 BTW) It took a while to start talking to her because we don&#039;t work in the same department and I almost never saw her at first. Well now I see her a lot more and we talk a lot more. After a few weeks of talking at work I...<br />

One thing I&#039;m slightly worried about is that one of her friends that I&#039;ve met, I got along with really well and would like to be able to build a friendship with her, but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s possible.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never been to a psychologist before but I want to see one for my (what I think anyhow) possible ADHD.<br />
<br />
I say a lot of dumb stuff to people and practically don&#039;t have a filter leading me to say inappropriate jokes to co-workers and close friends.  I really don&#039;t notice it until I&#039;m being introspective about how I act in public.<br />
<br />
Attentive wise, I&#039;m struggling a lot of days on concentrating on work.  I eventually get it done but I waste a ton of time during the day looking at reddit,...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ugh. So I didn&#039;t really wanna open up and converse about this because of internet trolls and such but I&#039;ve been really struggling with this issue for a while. So I was dating this girl for a couple months and then I grew very old of the commitment driven with a relationship so I called it quits. Months later I&#039;ve been talking to another girl and we hangout here and there but now when she asks me to hangout I think about all the other possible things I could be doing other than hanging out...<br />

I have already been going out something like 2-3 times per week, usually to clubs and pubs, It&#039;s been really hard for me personally, as I&#039;m not much of the the type of man who&#039;s famous for how sociable or outgoing he is. I felt somewhat awkward and also tense, in fact it is certainly...<br />

It can&#039;t be epididymitis or whatever as I&#039;m not exactly fucking people right now.]]></content:encoded>
