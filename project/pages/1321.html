      <content:encoded><![CDATA[(Hopefully I&#039;m not doing anything questionable, but do I want to know if it can be done)<br />
<br />
I used to edit music on my Windows laptop and am accustomed to using dll file-plugins. My issue is the one I really want to use is a dll and since those don&#039;t work on Mac.. I might be S.O.L.<br />
<br />
So is there a program that can attempt to modify them into a way that maybe I can use it? Or am I going to be stuck searching for another way to do things?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: From the research I&#039;ve done, there is no mac...<br />

I was looking for a way so they could backup all their stuff in case something happens. I looked into iCloud and it seems like it only backsup the photostream to icloud (which I believe is like the last 30 days worth of pics...not all of them).<br />

Is there a solution out there through icloud? I know some other apps like dropbox will let me back up pics, but I was hoping for something like icloud...<br />

I tried some things I found online like resetting a variety of things by holding down buttons, but to no avail. The asshole that sold it to me didn&#039;t even include the recovery disc(s). <br />

I&#039;m going to call Apple tomorrow, but I want to know of any other means to fix this before spending more money for discs or repairs<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[My contract is ending soon and I am stuck between both of Apple&#039;s new flagship devices. I am upgrading from a galaxy siii after 4 long years of using android. I just like the overall design of the iPhone better than most android phones. However, I am undecided between the 6 and the 6 plus. I love the big screen and battery life of the 6 plus, but I also like the compactness of the 6. I have a budget of $300-$400. Any help would be great, especially from those who have one or the other.]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I honestly have multiple times, and on multiple versions of iOS. i think my favorite iOS version was actually 6.1.3 that was like years ago and its when the whole jailbreaking scene was getting big. I remember I had wanted to jailbreak just to get more customization to my ipod since there really wasn&#039;t much you know?. but I remember when I first had discovered videos...</b><br />

My main question is I switch between my home/laptop/work/school computers often.  All my machines are mac&#039;s but the others are windows based machines.  <br />
<br />
Can i format the drive so that it will work on both platforms?  Would i have to save as to both partitions?  what would be the simplest way to use this between platforms...<br />

Tap to make popcorn! <br />
<br />
In this super simple yet insanely addicting game you&#039;ll be making more popcorn than you&#039;ll know what to do with. Tap to make popcorn in a meeting, during class, on the bus, waiting in line. Once you start popping you won&#039;t be able to stop. Your friends and family start to worry about when they haven&#039;t seen you in days. You are up to your eyes in popcorn. You begin to dream in popcorn. You only take breaks from popping popcorn to eat popcorn....<br />

I am so excited to show you BattleScan, my upcoming project soon to be released on Indiegogo.<br />
<br />
BattleScan is a mobile game based on scanning QRCodes or Barcodes on products and transforms them into awesome 3D characters. Players can scan any barcode/QR code with their mobile phone then watch how it transforms into 3D characters right on to the surface of the barcode using Augmented Reality. Then the monster can be collected and battled in several cool arenas!<br />

The idea of this game...<br />

I have a video that I exported from After Effects that is formatted to the aspect ratio of the iPhone 6, at a full resolution of 1500w2688, which is twice the pixels of the iPhone 6. I suspect my video exceeds a resolution limit, but if that&#039;s true, there&#039;s gotta be a way around it, right?<br />
